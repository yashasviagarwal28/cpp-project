#Drawing a shape:
puts "   /|" #puts is another command for print and it prints out the everything in the order it is coded on
puts "  / |" #puts also prints out another line
puts " /  |"
puts "/___|" #if this was printed in the beginning then this part of the triangle will print first
print "Hello World" #if printed first then the first puts "   /|" will be printed out with Hello World
puts ""
#ruby just prints out eveyrthing in order


#Variables:
#store container data inside variables, to modify we can just refer to the particular var
#can put the character's name and age and other details in different variables like name, age, etc
character_name = "John"
character_age = "35"
puts ("There once was a man named " + character_name)
#instead of just doing:    puts "There once was a man named John"
puts ("he was " + character_age + " years old.")
puts "He really liked the name John"
puts "but didn't like being 35."
